# Exercise: Revisiting the performance of axpy

In this exercise we improve the performance of the axpy code by taking into account non-uniform memory access in modern processors.

An example code is provided from the previous axpy exercise: a fully functional axpy code with timing.

The [solution directory](solution/) contains a model solution and discussion on the exercises below.


## Task: Improve the performance

1. According to the first touch policy, we need to do the initialization in parallel so that the arrays are allocated in each threads' NUMA domain.

   Do you see any difference in execution time with different numbers of threads and different affinities?

   Additional fix for C++ only:

   The arrays are allocated as `std::vector` that does zero-initialization of the underlying memory buffer on the calling thread.
   Fix this issue by first allocating the memory buffer with `malloc()` and mapping the buffer to a vector-like object `std::span`:

       double *_x = (double*)malloc(n * sizeof(double));
       std::span<double> x(_x, n);  // this x behaves like std::vector for the purposes of this exercise
       ...
       free(_x);
   
   Note that `std::span` requires a C++20 compatible compiler. For some compilers you may have to manually specify the standard:
      ```bash
      g++ -Wall -O3 -std=c++20 -fopenmp axpy.cpp -o axpy
      ```

3. (Bonus for C++) Use C++ unique pointer to wrap the C-style malloc and free for automatic freeing of memory.
